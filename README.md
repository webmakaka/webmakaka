### Hello ${userName}, if you watch video courses and read books, please share interesting projects with us!

Please use docker and kubernetes to deploy results with a few commands.

You can use minikube or <a href="https://github.com/webmakaka/vagrant-kubernetes-3-node-cluster-centos7">local kubernetes cluster</a> for this purposes.

For now I am watching a very interesting course <a href="https://github.com/webmakaka/TinyHouse-A-Fullstack-React-Masterclass-with-TypeScript-and-GraphQL">[NewLine] TinyHouse: A Fullstack React Masterclass with TypeScript and GraphQL [ENG, 2020]</a>

Can recommend this course to anyone who wants to study react / typescript / graphq.

I am trying to use latest packages and I use **skaffold** for develop apps right in **kubernetes**.

**Final Project should be:**  
https://www.tinyhouse.app/

If you watch this course, please send me link to your repo.
