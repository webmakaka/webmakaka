### Hello ${userName}, if you watch video courses and read books, please share interesting projects with us!

Please use docker and kubernetes to deploy results with a few commands.

You can use minikube or <a href="https://github.com/webmakaka/vagrant-kubernetes-3-node-cluster-centos7">local kubernetes cluster</a> for this purpose.

For now I am trying to run a <a href="https://github.com/webmakaka/k8s-rust-skaffold-demo">simple rust project</a> on minikube cluster.

I have no experience with the rust language, and the project is not even compiling. 

If you are interested in this theme, you can also work on this project and recommend solutions how to fix it. 


**Possible, can help to start!**
